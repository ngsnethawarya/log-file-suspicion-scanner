Log File Suspicion Scanner

This script scans a text-based log file and highlights
lines that may indicate suspicious activity.

It checks for common warning signs such as:
- Failed login attempts
- Unauthorized access
- Invalid passwords

This project demonstrates how basic log analysis
starts before advanced SIEM tools are used.


Run:
python log_scan.py
